hi there

here is a mobile phone whose model is implemented using Raspberry Pi.It makes use an Adafruit touchscreen interface and a Sim900 GSM/GPRS module to make phone calls. Itâ€™s more of a proof of concept to see what could be done with a relatively small form factor with off-the-shelf (cheap) components.
