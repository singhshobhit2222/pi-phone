hi there

here is a mobile phone whose model is implemented using Raspberry Pi.It makes use an Adafruit touchscreen interface and a Sim900 GSM/GPRS module to make phone calls. It’s more of a proof of concept to see what could be done with a relatively small form factor with off-the-shelf components. It’s a numeric keypad, with a display of the number to dial at the top, and a phone icon at the bottom to make or hang up the call.
